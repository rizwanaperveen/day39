//Question 118: Write a loop that logs numbers from 1 to 10 to the console.
//Explain & TIP: A for loop is a concise way to run a block of code a specific number of times. It's perfect for when you know exactly how many iterations you need.
for (var i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
//Question 119: Create a while loop that logs "Hello, World!" 5 times.
//Explain & TIP: A while loop continues to run as long as its condition remains true. Itâ€™s ideal for when you want to repeat something until a certain condition changes.
var count = 0;
while (count < 5) {
    console.log("Hello World");
    count++;
}
//Question 120: Use a for...of loop to iterate through an array of your favorite movies and log each one.
//Explain & TIP: The for...of loop is a modern loop introduced in ES6, designed to iterate over iterable objects like arrays, strings, Maps, NodeLists, and more, making it very readable and easy to use.
var favmovie = [
    "Inception",
    "The Matrix",
    "Interstellar",
    "The Prestige",
];
for (var _i = 0, favmovie_1 = favmovie; _i < favmovie_1.length; _i++) {
    var movie = favmovie_1[_i];
    console.log(movie);
}
